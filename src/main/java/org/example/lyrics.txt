Chorus
Well I'm a Son of Satan's Angels, and I fly the F-4D
All the way from the Hanoi railroad bridge to the DMZ
I'm one of old Hoot Gibson's boys, and mean as I can bе
I'm a Son of Satan's Angels, and I fly the F-4D

[Verse 1]
Therе ain't a triple-A gunner up there that's anywhere near my class
'Cause I'm as mad as I can be and I'm in for one more pass
He hosed me down one time too much and that one is his last
And I looked back at where he was; hey, man, ain't that a gas

[Chorus]
Well I'm a Son of Satan's Angels, and I fly the F-4D
All the way from the Hanoi railroad bridge to the DMZ
I'm one of old Hoot Gibson's boys, and mean as I can be
I'm a Son of Satan's Angels, and I fly the F-4D

[Verse 2]
Hello, Hanoi Hannah, send your MIGs to meet their doom
Flying 'em up and blast 'em off, Hoot's boys will be there soon
I don't care if you are the gal with a mouthful of silver spoon
'Cause I've got Sidewinders on board that'll home on an AB plume

[Chorus]
Well I'm a Son of Satan's Angels, and I fly the F-4D
All the way from the Hanoi railroad bridge to the DMZ
I'm one of old Hoot Gibson's boys, and mean as I can be
I'm a Son of Satan's Angels, and I fly the F-4D
